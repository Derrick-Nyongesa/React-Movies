## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Derrick-Nyongesa/React-Movies.git
cd React-Movies
```

### **2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Create a TMDB API key**

To fetch movie data, this app uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. Visit [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Create a free account (if you don’t have one).
3. Go to your **Settings → API** section.
4. Generate a **v3 API key**.

---

### **4. Add your API key to a `.env` file**

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following line:

```bash
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Do not share your API key publicly.
> Also, make sure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to keep it private.

---

### **5. Run the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
The page will automatically reload as you make changes.
